## Implementations

I have implemented the following algorithms:

- **BFS Algorithm**: Breadth-First Search algorithm for exploring nodes layer by layer.
- **A* Algorithm**: A pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that uses heuristics to improve efficiency.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: A decision rule for minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario.
- **Q-learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state.
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: Algorithms designed to learn optimal policies through rewards and penalties, specifically implemented for the Pacman game.

## Repository Contents
